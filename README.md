# touchmouse

Using Cirque circular 40mm touchpad

Code in progress.
Full BOM in progress.
Need to get a 3d printer to finish.

Acceleration works best, momentum is unreliable in practise.

6 buttons - LMB, MMB, RMB, Back, Forward and Scroll mode.

Scroll mode is active until the touchpad finger is released, then reverting to cursor mode.

Hold finger at edge to continue scrolling in that direction.

Use a sequence of taps in quick succession for custom commands

Works great with Kando or Flypie (Gnome only).

Possilibity of different horizontal/vertical scaling since it's easier to move up and down than left and right.

Parameters can be tuned on code or physically using potentiometers on the bottom.
